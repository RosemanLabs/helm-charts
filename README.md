# Deploying your own VDL server using helm
For ease of use, a Helm chart can be used to setup a complete VDL node on an existing Kubernetes cluster. This helm chart will deploy a StatefulSet which manages the VDL node, the services for connecting to it, a Kubernetes Secret for storing key material, and a persistent volume claim for storage. Optionally, a VPN client sidecar container will be deployed in the pod containing the VDL node, which can be used to connect the VDL node to any already existing OpenVPN server.

Due to the large number of values that need to be overwritten, we recommend deploying by running `deploy_single_node.sh` from the `scripts` directory instead of using helm commands directly.

With the following steps, you can setup your own VDL node:

1. Add the Roseman Labs helm chart repository (replace `REPO_NAME` with any name you want): `helm repo add REPO_NAME https://helm.rosemancloud.com`.
2. Receive from Roseman Labs the credentials needed for pulling the docker image (which will be used by the k8s/helm server).
3. Acquire the needed key material (discuss with your Roseman Labs contact on how to do this) and store it all in a single directory.
4. Create your override file based on the following template (see appendix 1 for details on the parameters):
    ```yaml
    imageCredentials:
      username: "USERNAME"
      password: "PASSWORD"
    core:
      nodeNr: "2"
      peerAHostname: "HOSTNAME"
      peerBHostname: "HOSTNAME"
      peerAPort: "6000"
      peerBPort: "6000"
    pvc:
      storageClassName: "standard"
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2Gi
      requests:
        cpu: 1
        memory: 2Gi
    ```
5. To include the Grafana logging stack you must first set up an openVPN server, this is a strict requirement for the logging stack to work. Once the VPN has been set up, a number of openVPN config files must be generated by the host of the server. 
  1. Each engine node needs its own vpn config.
  2. Loki (the log aggregator) needs it's own vpn config. This is important because otherwise the log forwarding sidecars (Grafana Alloy) will not be able to reach Loki.
  3. Grafana (the dashboarding tool) needs it's own vpn config. Otherwise the logs that have been forwarded to Loki cannot be accessed.

6. Once the VPN has been set up you need to set the following values in your specific override file. 
  1. If your deployment contains node0 then you must include the following override settings. Setting `isHost` to `true` will deploy Loki and Grafana in the same namespace as the engine (vdl) pod. 
```yaml
    logging:
      enabled: true
      isHost: true
      lokiEndpoint: http://{{ LOKI_VPN_IP }}:3100/loki/api/v1/push
    # The following settings are necessary to ensure that the preconfigured log dashboard connects to the right Loki instance. It is also possible to configure it by hand, but including these values will ensure that is deploys correctly.
    grafana:
      datasources:
        loki_datasource.yaml:
          datasources:
          - name: Loki
            type: loki
            url: http://{{ LOKI_VPN_IP }}:3100
  ```
  2. If your deployment contains either node1 or node2 then you must include the following override settings.
```yaml
    logging:
      enabled: true
      isHost: false
      lokiEndpoint: http://{{ LOKI_VPN_IP }}:3100/loki/api/v1/push
```
6. Run the `deploy_single_node.sh` script with the following format:
```
./deploy_single_node.sh [-c <engine_openvpn_file>] [-l <loki_openvpn_file>] [-g <grafana_openvpn_file>] <namespace> <override_file> <override_secrets_dir>
```
  - `-c <engine_openvpn_file>`: VPN configuration _(optional)_
  - `-l <loki_openvpn_file>`: VPN configuration _(required to make the logging stack work, required for Loki/Grafana host)_
  - `-g <grafana_openvpn_file>`: VPN configuration _(required to make the logging stack work, required for Loki/Grafana)_
  - `<namespace>`: Kubernetes namespace where the objects will be created
  - `<override_file>`: the name of the previously created override file
  - `<override_secrets_dir>`: the name of the directory that stores the generated (override) key material

# appendix II: values recognized by docker image

The docker image recognizes the following parameters. Not all of these values can be set via Helm; if you need to change those, you need to create a fork of our chart.

## Required environmental variables:

| Name                 | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NODE_NR              | Number in range \[0, 1, 2\], nodes should be deployed in descending order          |
| NODE_PEER_A_HOSTNAME | Hostname or IP address of peer a; Node 0 uses this to connect to Node 1            |
| NODE_PEER_B_HOSTNAME | Hostname or IP address of peer b; Node 0 and Node 1 use this to connect to node 2  |

## Optional environmental variables:

| Name                         | Description                                                                                                   |
